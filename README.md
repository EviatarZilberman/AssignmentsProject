This is my first asp.net core mvc 6 project. In this project I have studied a few issues:

1. Using logs.
2. Using Mongo as my database.
3. Alittle bit front-end and design.
4. Authentication.
5. Async methods.
6. Input validation.

Those issues I have studied are the beginning of a wonderful road to improve myself more. I hope this project will help other people understand asp.net core mvc 6 like it helped me.
